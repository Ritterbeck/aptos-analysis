Native Functions

Some functions do not have a body specified, and instead have the body provided
by the VM. These functions are marked native.

Without modifying the VM source code, a programmer cannot add new native
functions. Furthermore, it is the intent that native functions are used for
either standard library code or for functionality needed for the given Move
environment.

Most native functions you will likely see are in the standard library code such
as vector

module std::vector {
    native public fun empty<Element>(): vector<Element>;
    ...
}
